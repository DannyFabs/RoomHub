### Vision Statement
To transform shared living by simplifying household organization and helping people find the perfect roommates.

### Key Objectives:

* **Efficient Organization:** Streamlines expense tracking and chore management, reducing the complexity of shared living arrangements.
* **Informed Decisions:** The app enables users to find roommates who match their living style based on honest feedback from previous roommates.
* **Convenience:** Automated reminders and notifications keep users on top of payments and tasks, fostering a more organized and stress-free living environment.


### Core Features

* **Shared Expenses Calculator:**
Users can add and track expenses such as rent, groceries, and insurance, with a clear view of how much each person owes.

* **Tasks Organizer:**
Roommates can assign and manage household chores, ensuring that responsibilities are clearly defined and everyone knows their tasks.

* **Reminders and Notifications:**
The app sends alerts for upcoming payments and pending tasks, helping users stay organized and on track.

* **Rate Your Roommate: - Not implemented yet**
Users can rate and provide detailed feedback about their roommates, offering valuable insights that help future users make informed decisions.

### Technology Stack

* #### Front End:
  * **Flutter:**
  A cross-platform framework for creating high-performance applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different devices. Flutter will be used for the mobile and desktop applications.

* #### Back End:

  * **Express:**
  A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that is ideal for handling HTTP requests and server-side logic efficiently, making it a suitable choice for API development. Hosted on AWS Lambda

  * **Database:**
    **DynamoDb:**
    A managed nosql database service service that has direct javascript compatibility, offering automated backups, scaling, and high availability. This will serve as the primary database for the app, ensuring robust data management and reliability.
